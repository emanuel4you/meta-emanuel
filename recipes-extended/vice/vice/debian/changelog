  * Works fine with /dev/dsp in use (not in the main changelog, but tested
    on my local machine as working).  Presumably, this also takes care of
    the issue with dsp being held.  I'm not sure if this is because I'm
    testing it on a 2.6 kernel now -- if you are still having problems

vice (1.14-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version (closes: #230571)
  * The vkm files (and others) are now in the right place -- somehow the
    Makefile.am for the data directory had become a zero-byte file in the
    upstream tarball had become a zero-byte file.  Copying it back in from
    an old 1.11 archive fixed the issue (closes: #223410, but this needs
    to be sent upstream.) 
  * Now that missing files are back in place, the floating point
    exceptions should be gone (closes: #210808)
  * REALLY add the build-dependency on gettext (how the heck did that
    happen?) (closes: #216759)
  * Corrected the information in the man page about the official web page
    location and the location of the documentation (closes: #231469)
  * All emulator menu entries have icons at this point, though they are
    too small for the differences to be easily discernable.  However, I'm
    calling that "good enough" and closing this bug (closes: #175015)
  * Stop using xaw3dg -- this clears up the problem with menu items going
    black (closes: #159956).

    * Added menu icons for xvic and x128, and a menu entry for xcbm2

vice (1.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Floating point exception fixed (closes: #210808)
  * I attempted to compile this version with --with-gnomeui, but it failed
    to compile with either the includes from gtk-1.2 or gtk-2.0, so it's
    back to to xaw3d.
  * With the requirement for the icon colormap to match cmap.xpm removed,
    I tried rescaling again.  This time, only *most* of the pixmaps are
    unreadable, so after tweaking the x64, xpet, and xplus4 icons, I'm
    using them.  Nothing I did made the C128 and CBM2, and VIC-20 icons
    readable, however.  I changed the names to add in the resolution as
    well.  (Partly deals with Bug#175015)
  * Builders beware - this version appears to destroy a font file in the
    build directory while building, so if you build, you must currently
    destroy the build directory and unpack again before building a second
    time.  I'm looking into a way to deal with this, but it will always
    build fine the first time so I'm judging this fit to upload.
  * Standards-Version: 3.6.0
  * /usr/share/doc/common-licenses changed to /usr/share/common-licenses
    in debian/copyright

vice (1.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modify src/arch/unix/archdep.h to point at the correct location
    for documentation (closes: #189500)
  * Fix typo in menu (Commdore -> Commodore) (closes: #175013)
  * Regarding Bug#175015: icons have been taken out src/arch/unix/x11
    and placed in debian/ in the source package for further
    enhancement.  Currently they have a transparent background and
    have colors matching cmap.xpm, but they are 48x42 images, which
    are too large.  Scaling them down to 32x28 makes the text in the
    lower right hand corner pretty much unreadable.  Tampering with them
    with the Gimp messed up the colors again, so I'm giving up for now.
    The 48x42 images are placed in /usr/share/pixmaps for people to play
    with independently if they want.  This means that any future
    adjustments to them need to go in under a new filename so people using
    the ones I have in now don't get surprised by a size change.

    the right to distribute those ROM files is questionable, this needs to
    go into the archives as soon as possible and vice 1.7 needs to be
    removed from all archives.  (closes: #130474)

vice (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (closes: #82592).  The orig.tar.gz file will not
    match the upstream tarball, as upstream put the ROM images back into
    the main tarball, and they have been zeroed out in the orig.tar.gz.
    They are not included with the .deb at all, so the unofficial
    vice-roms package will still work.
  * This will also fix the build problem on alpha (closes: #82616)
  * DH_COMPAT=3 (Build-Depends updated)
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.2
  * The 1541II ROM really *is* being looked for as d1541II, not dos1541II,
    it was just my local config which was different.  README.ROMs updated
    about this (closes: #86547)

    closures here.  (closes: #17876, #53459)
  * New upstream version, using the no-roms-included source package
    (closes: #27548, #47056)
  * This version should have no compilation or dependency problems with
    libreadline, libncurses, or xpm4g.  (closes: #63365, #67973)
  * Created blank 0-length images in the data/* area.  They are not
    included in the final package, and are created this way only to make
    the Makefiles happy.  I could have modified the Makefile.ins, but I
    thought this way left an easier transition should someday it become
    possible to use the ROMs-included version.
  * Edited the docs list.  Most notably, mnemonics.txt seems to have gone
    away.
  * vice-getroms has been removed completely, and replaced with a README
    about where to get the VICE ROMs package, now that it's in an easily
    usable tarball.  Reference to it has been removed from the preinst.
    This is kind of a wimp-out, but it closes: #37904, #45823, #62478

    and GPL license.
  * Redid the menu file.  Xterms aren't used at all anymore.
