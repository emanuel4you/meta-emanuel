Description: Versatile Commodore Emulator
 VICE emulates well the hardware of the Commodore Business Machines of
 the pre-Amiga era. Supported are the various Pets, the VIC-20, the
 Commodore 64, the Commodore 128, the CBM-II series, and the PLUS/4.
 .
 Some alternate keywords for the above: VIC20, C64, C=64, C64 DTV, C128,
 C=128, CBM-500, CBM-600, CBM-700, PLUS4 .
 .
 This package does not contain the various ROM images needed to
 actually use the emulators; they are available separately from other
 locations (see the README.ROMs file).  A corporation in the
 Netherlands called Tulip holds the copyrights to the ROM images, and
 redistribution is not permitted, but VICE itself is unencumbered.
