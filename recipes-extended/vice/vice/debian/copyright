This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the VICE suite.
This package provides the emulators for that classic machine of the
eighties, the Commodore 64, and its cousins.

This package was created from sources made available via the VICE home
page at http://www.viceteam.org/ but the ROM files distributed with
the version that can be downloaded there have been removed from the
Debian source package.
